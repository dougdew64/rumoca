# CLAUDE.md — HRW Observatory

**Purpose:** the rules that bind, what is being worked on now, and where everything else lives.
**Status:** authority. **The one file to read at session start.**
**Read when:** every session, first.

Rust/egui observatory for studying the Rumoca Modelica compiler.
**[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) is the document index** — every file, its purpose, and
whether it is live. Go there rather than guessing.

Purpose, scope and binding decisions are in [`docs/CHARTER.md`](docs/CHARTER.md) (v1.1) —
consult it for any design question; **do not re-litigate settled decisions in-session.**
Append any nontrivial implementation choice to [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md) with a one-line
rationale.

---

## The rules

**Instrumentation of the Rumoca crates is intended, and must stay additive,
observation-only, and upstreamable.** Across a crate boundary a phase's `pub(crate)` internals
are unreachable, so "accessing internals" means **additively widening visibility / adding
observation hooks in `../crates/rumoca-*`**. Semantics-preserving, so HRW stays faithful to
real Rumoca and rebases stay clean.

- **After touching a `crates/rumoca-*` file, run `cargo clippy -p <that-crate> --all-targets`.**
  Those crates are clippy-clean and `[workspace.lints]` denies; a lint the instrumentation
  introduces fails upstream CI.
- **Commit Rumoca crate changes separately from HRW code**, so an upstream PR is a clean
  cherry-pick.
- **Ask before adding a dependency.** Record accepted ones in `DECISIONS.md`.

**THE MUST-FIRE RULE.** Any code whose job is to *report* something gets a test proving it
reports; **silence must be a failure, never a pass.** Its absence makes a change incomplete.
All seven silent bugs of 2026-08-01 were observers that looked like they worked: a dead column,
an array argument collapsed by `powershell -File`, an `eprintln!` swallowed by HRW's own
fd-level `OutputCapture`, a rate limiter gating its own first fire, an announcement silent when
work was pending by absence. `fidelity.rs` had this discipline
(`each_invariant_catches_its_own_violation`); the tooling around it did not.

**DO NOT optimise HRW to widen test scope** (Doug, 2026-07-31 — standing boundary,
[`docs/fidelity-plan.md`](docs/fidelity-plan.md)). Measurement showed HRW's *compile path*, not
the checks, costs 30 s and 3.5 GB on a 4,193-equation model. Doug: *"we should not redesign
worker.rs's compile path. Perhaps ever… If some models cannot be fidelity-tested within our
limits, so be it."* The stage JSON trees, equation sheet, identifier index and animation frames
**are the product**. Raising `-TimeoutSec` / `-MaxProcGB` when measurement justifies it is
calibration, not optimisation, and is fine. **HRW is an education project, not a production
tool.**

**The composition primitives are frozen** — one point-at + one follow + background, unchanged
until a practical scenario demonstrates a need. Multiple `follow` items and a third "compare"
primitive were considered and deliberately not built; **do not re-propose them from first
principles.**

**No heuristic name-matching** — [`docs/identity-and-provenance.md`](docs/identity-and-provenance.md).
No substring search ever decides identity. Cited by six source files.

**Documents divide by audience, and so does who judges them** ([`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md),
2026-08-01). Everything except READMEs is **Claude's, maintained without asking** —
reorganise, condense, delete a rotted file, correct a stale claim, all on Claude's own
judgement. **READMEs and their further reading are for Doug and Rumoca maintainers**, and the
test is whether a reader acts without asking Claude; an index link is not an endorsement, and
a README states facts it does not own **by reference, never transcription**. **`hrw/README.md`'s
value case is a joint rewrite** — keep that file accurate and current, but **do not invest in
persuasion alone**: whether prose lands is the one signal Claude cannot generate, and the
solo attempt at explanation (`end_to_end_tour.md`) is the project's clearest failure.

**Tech-debt sweeps have TWO triggers** ([`docs/tech-debt.md`](docs/tech-debt.md)). Forward:
each phase boundary, scoped to what the next phase touches. Backward (added 2026-08-01): **code
that has produced defects only a human caught.** Ask *"who caught it?"* — toolchain, nothing to
sweep; Doug, the code lives somewhere nothing checks. The property is **verifiability, not
Rust**; adding a test, a non-vacuity guard, or a loud failure is often cheaper than converting.

---

## Current work

**Pass two: re-implement Arcs 1-7 with internal Rumoca access, delivering richer stage views
than the public API allowed.** Per arc: scout what state the phase holds (read the crate under
`../crates/`), expose it additively, render it. Remaining per-arc opportunities are
`docs/ideas.md` #19-#22. The log view is delivered. Pass-one closure record and the arc history
are in [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md).

**[`docs/current-work.md`](docs/current-work.md) is the live step-by-step plan.** Delete it
when the sweep's findings have landed.

**The sequence (Doug, 2026-07-31) — each step's output is the next step's input:**

1. **The MSL survey** ✅ — `examples/survey_msl.rs`. Rumoca's reach across all 2,626 MSL models,
   plus the IR-shape metrics that stratify the sample.
2. **Fidelity testing at scale** ✅ — F1-F9 over that corpus. **2,614 of 2,626 models green**
   (2026-08-01); 12 exceeded this machine's memory or the time limit.
3. **Test mode + fidelity-report support** — load a report in the LHS, click a model, open it
   compiled in the RHS (`docs/ideas.md` **#52**).
   - **3b. PAUSE — [`docs/verification-plan.md`](docs/verification-plan.md)** (agreed
     2026-08-01). Six items *before* oracle testing and Test mode: the must-fire convention,
     **the stale-negative test** (a claim of *absence* must be checkable — the mirror of
     `doc_citations.rs`), **clearing HRW's 67 clippy warnings and then denying them**,
     shortening the pre-commit suite (#48), **headless UI testing with `egui_kittest`**
     (dev-dependency, approved), and moving the run drivers to Rust. Doug: *"Anything which
     slows down your ability to help bring my ideas to life is absolutely worth fixing now."*
4. **Design and run the oracle test** — Rumoca vs System Modeler (#43). **Constrained by
   [`docs/reports.md`](docs/reports.md):** it must emit the same `name` join key, because a
   mismatch is only an admissible upstream finding when that model is *fidelity-green*.
5. **Oracle-report support in Test mode**, with per-item state (unfiled / filed / fixed
   upstream) that regeneration merges rather than overwrites.

**[`docs/reports.md`](docs/reports.md) is the design authority for steps 3-5.** Its load-bearing
claim: **survey → eligible, fidelity → trustworthy, oracle → findings.**

**One dependency the sequence hid, now met:**

- ~~Step 3 needs a compile-by-qualified-name path in the worker.~~ ✅ **`WorkerState::compile_model_by_name`
  exists** — built for step 2, since checking HRW's representation of an MSL model means
  compiling it *through HRW's own path*, which is the thing under test. *(Corrected 2026-08-01;
  this was listed as missing after it shipped.)* Note **why it could not just call `compile`
  with the library file**: a library file may declare many classes — `Blocks/Continuous.mo`
  holds `CriticalDamping` among others — so "the first class in the file" is the wrong model.
  The document is **located, not added**.

**One risk in the ordering:**

- **The n=1 risk.** Test mode is built at step 3 with only *one* real report to
  load, then asked to take a second at step 5 — an abstraction fitted to n=1. Half the
  mitigation is made: all three reports share the first four columns (`name`, `kind`,
  `outcome`, `message`). The other half is to **sketch the oracle report's columns during
  step 3**, without building the oracle.

## Running things

```text
cargo test -p hrw --lib -- --test-threads=1                        # ~25s, 412 tests — between edits
cargo test -p hrw --lib --features slow-tests -- --test-threads=1  # ~6min, 471 tests — before committing
cargo clippy -p hrw --all-targets                                  # covers the BIN; check the exit code
```

**`--test-threads=1` is required** — two pre-existing tests race on process-global stdout and
on `focus.json`, and the suite can **hang** under the default harness on a clean tree.

**`cargo test` does not build the binary, and that gap is not theoretical.** On 2026-07-31 a
`#[cfg(test)]` was placed above the first of three lifted helpers — **the attribute applies to
one item** — so two compiled into `--bin hrw` referencing test-only imports. Every test passed;
**Doug's debugger launch failed.** `cargo clippy --all-targets` covers the bin, **but check its
exit code, not its output**: the same breakage survived a clippy run piped to
`grep -c "^warning: "`, which counts warnings and silently ignores a compile error.

**Use the fast suite between edits and the full one before every commit.** Measured 2026-07-29:
49 of 402 tests took 180 of the suite's 183 seconds, nearly all compiling a specimen against the
MSL. They are gated by `slow-tests` and reported as ignored *with a reason*. **Parallelism is
not the fix** — they serialize on a global `Mutex<WorkerState>` regardless, saving about two
seconds; `docs/ideas.md` **#48** (memoize compiled specimens) is.

**Long runs → [`docs/long-runs.md`](docs/long-runs.md)**, the runbook for the MSL survey and the
fidelity sweep: copy-paste commands, what to watch, how to resume, what each abort verdict
means. *Why* each precaution exists is `docs/architecture.md` §11.

**NEVER run the fidelity sweep unbounded, and never in a bare loop.** An unbounded 53-model run
made Doug's machine unusable and forced a hard power-cycle (2026-07-31). Use the watchdog:

```powershell
# stop rust-analyzer FIRST via Ctrl+Shift+P -> "rust-analyzer: Stop server"
./scripts/measure-fidelity.ps1 -ModelsFile C:/tmp/all-models.txt `
    -Out C:/tmp/fid-full.csv -Profile C:/tmp/fid-full-memory.csv
```

**One model per process**, so the worst case is bounded by a single model. **A session rebuild
is not a memory bound** — it releases what the session holds, not what the allocator
fragmented. **Only process exit is.** The watchdog guards on **free RAM** (3 GB floor), not
process size, sampled during the run: Doug proposed a 30 GB ceiling on a 31.7 GB machine, and
*a guard that cannot fire is indistinguishable from no guard*.

- Long runs go in a **standalone terminal**, not VS Code's.
- Output goes to `C:\Users\dougd\rumoca-runs\`, **never `C:\tmp`**, and is promoted into `docs/`
  by `scripts/promote-run.ps1`, which writes the provenance sidecar.
- **Do not rebuild an example while a run holds its binary.**
- **Stop rust-analyzer first** — it holds ~5.7 GB here. **Do not kill the process**; VS Code
  treats that as a crash and restarts it within seconds.

**When the fidelity checks run** (policy 2026-07-31; reasoning in
[`docs/fidelity-plan.md`](docs/fidelity-plan.md)). Small scale — the 16 curated specimens —
**stays in the pre-commit run** (~90 s), answering *"did HRW drift from itself?"*, which is not
a rare event: both bugs found on 2026-07-31 were HRW-internal drift, weeks old. Large scale gets
its own feature gate. Run the large suite: **(1)** after rebasing on upstream (a step in
`docs/updating-rumoca.md`); **(2)** before submitting a PR to CogniPilot/rumoca; **(3)** when
HRW changes how it **emits or reads stage JSON** — the `*_to_json` functions in `worker.rs`, the
path grammar in `bridge.rs`, `IncidenceMatrix::from_report`, or any animation's re-derivation.
**Trigger 3 is code-shaped, not judgement-shaped, deliberately** — "when a change gives reason
to doubt fidelity" is exactly the judgement that already failed twice.

## Where things live

- **Rumoca source** — HRW lives **inside** the fork; read the sibling `../crates/...` directly.
  It is the exact tree HRW builds against, no Cargo-cache indirection. "Updating Rumoca" means
  **rebasing the `hrw` branch on upstream**, per
  [`docs/updating-rumoca.md`](docs/updating-rumoca.md).
- **[`docs/compiler-phases/`](docs/compiler-phases/) — Claude's teaching database.** **Audience
  is Claude, not Doug**, who reads it only indirectly through answers; Claude maintains and
  commits it. Start at
  [`the-chain-of-problems.md`](docs/compiler-phases/the-chain-of-problems.md). **What goes in:**
  Doug's *questions*, the confusion behind them, and what made a thing click — **not** Claude's
  explanations, which are regenerable and build an echo chamber a later session mistakes for
  fact. **Every claim carries provenance** ([`docs/provenance.md`](docs/provenance.md));
  untagged prose is a **lead, not a fact**, and upgrades lazily when a real question sends
  Claude into the source. Two tests in `src/doc_citations.rs` check that cited paths exist.
- **[`docs/question-ledger.md`](docs/question-ledger.md)** — Doug's questions verbatim and what
  made each click. **Scan it before answering in a familiar area.** A repeat branches two ways
  demanding opposite responses: the concept is hard (try a different angle), or the thing is not
  visible in HRW (a feature request, better than any Claude invents).
- **[`docs/upstream-strategy.md`](docs/upstream-strategy.md)** — **consult when planning work**,
  not only when preparing something to send. Engagement is a **means** to Doug's education, so
  questions must be worth answering: *"here are 380 MSL models failing at flatten with the same
  error shape — expected?"* beats *"why does X?"*. **Order deliverables by their cost to accept,
  not our effort** — bug reports with System Modeler adjudication, an MSL capability map and
  differential testing are zero-cost gifts; **HRW goes last**, being the only item asking for
  maintenance burden. Anything published must be **reproducible** and **honestly bounded**.
- **[`docs/upstream-issues.md`](docs/upstream-issues.md)** — **Claude adds entries and never
  files them.** Only *reproduced* bugs, with suspect code marked unverified: a confident wrong
  diagnosis wastes a maintainer's time and costs the credibility this project is building.
- **[`docs/fixture-tours/`](docs/fixture-tours/) — tours that are *tests*, not explanations.**
  Versioned, unlike an ad hoc tour (`.hrw-bridge/tour.md`, gitignored). **Only justified because
  something runs them:** `fixture_tour_links_all_resolve` parses every link on every test run.
  Three rules, each bought with a defect:
  - **One tour per capability, narrow.** The scarce resource is **Doug's attention per
    expectation**, not his walks; a wide tour consumes the surplus that produced the off-stop
    findings (`docs/ideas.md` #49).
  - **An expectation must say WHERE to look.** Doug reported "nothing happened" at a stop that
    was correctly refused with the reason on screen — the tour never said notices live in the
    status bar.
  - **Every `**Expected:**` line must be violable.** "Mostly collapsed" where the truth is
    *fully* collapsed tests nothing, and hedged expectations teach Doug to read them loosely.
- **[`docs/specimen-notebook/`](docs/specimen-notebook/)** — per specimen: `trace/` (durable
  per-stage IR + manifest, from `cargo run --example gen_trace -- <Model>`, **generated and
  therefore correct by construction — any number about a specimen is read from here**) and
  `purpose.md` (why it exists; rendered as the Purpose tab).
- Architectural invariants are in Rumoca's numbered SPEC files; comments cite Modelica Language
  Specification sections. **Respect phase boundaries** — IR crates are pure data.

## Architecture rules (charter §4.4, Decision 6)

- Rumoca is linked **as a library**, via path deps on `../crates/rumoca-*`. **Never shell out to
  the Rumoca CLI.** A load-IR-from-JSON import path is retained as a secondary mode only.
- Compilation and simulation run on a **worker thread**, results returned over a channel. The
  egui `update()` loop never blocks and never calls the compiler or solver directly.
- Native builds only. No WASM, no web deployment (charter Decision 5).
- **One generic serde-value tree inspector** pointed at every stage's IR — not per-stage bespoke
  tree widgets. Graph and custom-painter views arrive in their own arcs.
- **New pipeline stages must be wired into ALL per-stage systems** — stage-diff highlight,
  stage-file publishing, and the notebook trace.

## Debugging conventions

The VS Code debugger is a first-class learning instrument: structure code so a breakpoint can be
set inside a Rumoca phase while it processes a specimen.

- Breakpoints belong in **actions** (button handlers, worker tasks), **never in the per-frame
  paint path.** Keep compile/simulate logic out of rendering code.
- `[profile.dev.package]`: keep full debug info on all Rumoca crates.
- Setup, launch config and failure signatures: [`docs/setup-windows.md`](docs/setup-windows.md).

## Specimen rules (charter §4.3, §4.1)

- Specimens live in `specimens/`, authored in Wolfram System Modeler, in the **portable Modelica
  subset** — no Wolfram extensions. Done = compiles and runs equivalently in both.
- **Every specimen carries a `// purpose:` comment** (one line, phenomenon-focused), plus a
  `docs/specimen-notebook/<Model>/` trace and `purpose.md`.
- **Scratch specimens live in `.hrw-bridge/specimens/`** — Claude writes them mid-conversation to
  answer a question; HRW lists them within a second, no restart. **Not** held to the rules above,
  and **ephemeral by construction**. **A scratch name may not shadow a curated one** — the
  collision is reported and the file skipped, because silently loading a different model than the
  name says would have Claude reason confidently about source Doug is not looking at.
- **No MSL MultiBody.** Mechanical components come from our own small planar library.
- Comparison protocol: identical solver tolerances and initial conditions, explicit `experiment`
  annotations; agreement metric = relative error on state trajectories and event-time deltas.
- **Prefer standards** — MSL and portable Modelica over custom implementations.

## Arc close-out ritual

An arc is done when: (1) the specimen passes the differential test in both toolchains; (2) the
arc's observatory pane renders the relevant IR; (3) Doug has single-stepped the phase in the
debugger on that specimen; (4) the trace log (IR before/after) is captured; (5) this file's
Current work section is advanced. *(Gates 1 and 3 are under review — treat as
satisfiable-by-acceptance; `docs/ideas.md` #4.)*
