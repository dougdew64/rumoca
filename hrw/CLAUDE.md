# CLAUDE.md — HRW Observatory

**Purpose:** the rules that bind, what is being worked on now, and where everything else lives.
**Status:** authority. **The one file to read at session start.**
**Read when:** every session, first.

Rust/egui observatory for studying the Rumoca Modelica compiler.
**[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) is the document index** — every file, its purpose, and
whether it is live. Go there rather than guessing.

Purpose, scope and binding decisions are in [`docs/CHARTER.md`](docs/CHARTER.md) (v1.1) —
consult it for any design question; **do not re-litigate settled decisions in-session.**
Append any nontrivial implementation choice to [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md) with a one-line
rationale.

**[`docs/working-with-doug.md`](docs/working-with-doug.md) — read it too.** Who Doug is and
how he learns, which nothing else in this repository carries. The short form:

- **Decades of C/C++/Java, new to Rust and egui.** The gap is *idiom*, not concepts —
  translate (`trait` ≈ interface, ownership ≈ RAII + move), and frame Modelica-compiler
  concepts as **introductions, not reminders**.
- **Top-down, and problem before solution.** State the problem a step solves before the
  mechanism; he learns by understanding *why*.
- **The conversation is the instrument.** Sessions are teaching dialogues; **code changes are
  a byproduct of understanding, not the deliverable.** Explain the math alongside the code and
  name the textbook algorithm.
- **Propose features unprompted** that would deepen understanding — he asked for this, and the
  success metric is his understanding, not feature count.
- **Every change ships with tests, comments and doc updates**, unasked. **The source is itself
  a learning artifact**, so clean commented code ranks with the explanations, not below them.
- **Learning over polish**; **prefer Rust/egui over VS Code work**; **token cost is not a
  constraint** — never trade richness for economy.

## The rules

**Instrumentation of the Rumoca crates is intended, and must stay additive,
observation-only, and upstreamable.** Across a crate boundary a phase's `pub(crate)` internals
are unreachable, so "accessing internals" means **additively widening visibility / adding
observation hooks in `../crates/rumoca-*`**. Semantics-preserving, so HRW stays faithful to
real Rumoca and rebases stay clean.

- **After touching a `crates/rumoca-*` file, run `cargo clippy -p <that-crate> --all-targets`.**
  Those crates are clippy-clean and `[workspace.lints]` denies; a lint the instrumentation
  introduces fails upstream CI.
- **Commit Rumoca crate changes separately from HRW code**, so an upstream PR is a clean
  cherry-pick.
- **Ask before adding a dependency.** Record accepted ones in `DECISIONS.md`.
- **After changing traced algorithm code, update the guided tours.**
  `docs/compiler-phases/*/guided-tour.md` quote **line numbers, code excerpts, locals and enum
  variants** from `crates/rumoca-phase-structural/` (`matching.rs`, `tarjan.rs`,
  `live_trace.rs`). **Nothing compiles them, so they go stale silently** and a learner
  following one with wrong line numbers is simply confused. Grep the tours for any name that
  moved. This applies to *any* such change, not only a rebase — `docs/updating-rumoca.md`
  step 6 is the rebase instance of the same rule.

**When you write a memory, name where it belongs in the repo** (`DECISIONS.md`, "the
repository is the system of record"). **The memory store does not survive a clone** — it lives
outside the repo, keyed to the project's filesystem *path*, so a different machine *or a
different clone path* loses all of it. If a fact has no home in the repository, that is the
finding.

**THE MUST-FIRE RULE.** Any code whose job is to *report* something gets a test proving it
reports; **silence must be a failure, never a pass.** Its absence makes a change incomplete.
All seven silent bugs of 2026-08-01 were observers that looked like they worked: a dead column,
an array argument collapsed by `powershell -File`, an `eprintln!` swallowed by HRW's own
fd-level `OutputCapture`, a rate limiter gating its own first fire, an announcement silent when
work was pending by absence. `fidelity.rs` had this discipline
(`each_invariant_catches_its_own_violation`); the tooling around it did not.

**A PANE IS A REPORTER TOO, so a new pane that reports something ships with a headless
test** (added 2026-08-01). The Context Bar showed three true things and silently omitted a
fourth — the background — for weeks, because **a partial report leaves no gap where the
missing part was**: everything on screen was correct. Doug caught it; nothing could have.
Retrofitting the existing panes is logged in [`docs/tech-debt.md`](docs/tech-debt.md) ("UI
testing debt"), which also records what `egui_kittest` genuinely cannot reach — **only two
surfaces**, `incidence_view.rs` cells and `spyplot.rs`; the animations *are* testable.
**Not growing the debt is free.**

**INSERT A TEST AFTER A FUNCTION'S CLOSING BRACE, never before its `fn` line.** A doc comment
and its attributes sit *above* the item, so anything placed between them is adopted by the
wrong one — the new test gets two `#[test]`s and **the old function silently stops being a
test.** Nothing fails; the suite goes green. This has bitten three times: it broke Doug's
debugger launch on 2026-07-31 and twice disabled
`a_broken_specimen_does_not_poison_the_next_compile` on 2026-08-01.
`doc_citations::no_function_has_two_test_attributes` now catches it.

**EDIT FILES WITH THE EDIT/WRITE TOOLS. Do not generate source text through a shell.** Three
separate corruptions on 2026-08-01 share this one root, and they were *silent* — the tool
reported success every time:

- **Shell quoting ate content.** `python -c "…"` in Bash: backticks became command
  substitution and swallowed two file paths, including the one pointer that made a memory
  useful. Never route content containing backticks, `$` or backslashes through `-c` or a
  heredoc.
- **Escapes leaked one language into another.** Generating Rust from Python string literals
  put a literal `\u{2014}` into comment text. Content must be **literal in the tool call**, not
  a string inside a string.
- **Line arithmetic stole an attribute.** Inserting by index instead of by seen context put a
  test between a doc comment and its `fn`, silently un-testing a regression guard.

**A generator script is the exception, not the tool of choice.** When one is genuinely
warranted, write it with the Write tool and run it by path — that pattern never produced shell
corruption. And **read back anything a shell wrote.**

**Do not sell the `app.rs` refactor on these.** A large file *pressures* Claude toward
generators, but the corruption is a habit that operates on small files too — the memory case
proves it. Recorded 2026-08-02 after Doug pushed back on exactly that over-claim: the
refactor's justification is blast radius and testability, measured in
[`docs/ui-pause-plan.md`](docs/ui-pause-plan.md), and it did not need the help.

**DO NOT COMMIT TROUBLESHOOTING INSTRUMENTATION, AND DO NOT CALL AN UNCONFIRMED FIX A FIX**
*(Doug, 2026-08-03, after the LHS-width episode)*. Ten commits went into one 40 %-width bug:
**two were pure instrumentation and four were fixes that did not work.**

- **A probe lives in the working tree until it earns permanence.** It reaches Doug's running
  app by being *edited* — he builds from the tree — so committing adds nothing and pushing adds
  less. Commit it only once it is something the repository should keep, and say why.
- **A fix that cannot be reproduced locally is a hypothesis.** Say so in the subject line, not
  three paragraphs down. Four of those commits read as fixes and were not.

**The cost is not tidiness.** This repository is **public**, and `docs/upstream-strategy.md`
stakes Doug's credibility with Rumoca maintainers on work that is *reproducible and honestly
bounded*. A log showing six superseded commits for one bug reads as thrashing, whatever the
messages say. The failure was applying a work-product ritual — green suite, commit, push — to a
probe, using *"is this verified?"* as the test instead of *"should the repository keep this?"*

**TAG A CLAIM OF ABSENCE, or it rots unnoticed.** The must-fire rule pointed at silence; this
is the same principle pointed at **absence**. When a document says something is not built,
tag it so the claim is checkable:

```markdown
Sorting the corpus is not built. <!-- unbuilt: survey::sort_rows -->
```

**Name the symbol as it will actually be spelled.** The example above used to read
`survey_filter`, and `ideas.md` carried that tag for a day after the filter shipped as
`matches_filter` — **the tag passed the whole time, because it resolved nothing.** A tag that
resolves nothing is indistinguishable from a claim that is still true, so the checker was green
on a claim that was false. The mechanism only fails when the target *does* resolve; a
misspelled target is silently permanent.

`doc_citations::claims_of_absence_are_still_true` fails if the target **does** resolve.
**A wrong negative is the one error nobody catches**: acting on a wrong *positive* means
going to use the thing and finding it missing, while acting on a wrong *negative* means **not
looking**. Four stale ones were found on 2026-08-01, and `ideas.md` #42 was two days from
having its link vocabulary re-implemented on top of itself. Coverage is expected to be low —
tag when you write the claim, the way provenance tags work.

**DO NOT optimise HRW to widen test scope** (Doug, 2026-07-31 — standing boundary,
[`docs/fidelity-plan.md`](docs/fidelity-plan.md)). Measurement showed HRW's *compile path*, not
the checks, costs 30 s and 3.5 GB on a 4,193-equation model. Doug: *"we should not redesign
worker.rs's compile path. Perhaps ever… If some models cannot be fidelity-tested within our
limits, so be it."* The stage JSON trees, equation sheet, identifier index and animation frames
**are the product**. Raising `-TimeoutSec` / `-MaxProcGB` when measurement justifies it is
calibration, not optimisation, and is fine. **HRW is an education project, not a production
tool.**

**The composition primitives are frozen** — one point-at + one follow + background, unchanged
until a practical scenario demonstrates a need. Multiple `follow` items and a third "compare"
primitive were considered and deliberately not built; **do not re-propose them from first
principles.**

**No heuristic name-matching** — [`docs/identity-and-provenance.md`](docs/identity-and-provenance.md).
No substring search ever decides identity. Cited by six source files.

**Documents divide by audience, and so does who judges them** ([`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md),
2026-08-01). Everything except READMEs is **Claude's, maintained without asking** —
reorganise, condense, delete a rotted file, correct a stale claim, all on Claude's own
judgement. **READMEs and their further reading are for Doug and Rumoca maintainers**, and the
test is whether a reader acts without asking Claude; an index link is not an endorsement, and
a README states facts it does not own **by reference, never transcription**. **`hrw/README.md`'s
value case is a joint rewrite** — keep that file accurate and current, but **do not invest in
persuasion alone**: whether prose lands is the one signal Claude cannot generate, and the
solo attempt at explanation (`end_to_end_tour.md`) is the project's clearest failure.

**Tech-debt sweeps have TWO triggers** ([`docs/tech-debt.md`](docs/tech-debt.md)). Forward:
each phase boundary, scoped to what the next phase touches. Backward (added 2026-08-01): **code
that has produced defects only a human caught.** Ask *"who caught it?"* — toolchain, nothing to
sweep; Doug, the code lives somewhere nothing checks. The property is **verifiability, not
Rust**; adding a test, a non-vacuity guard, or a loud failure is often cheaper than converting.

---

## Current work

**Pass two: re-implement Arcs 1-7 with internal Rumoca access, delivering richer stage views
than the public API allowed.** Per arc: scout what state the phase holds (read the crate under
`../crates/`), expose it additively, render it. Remaining per-arc opportunities are
`docs/ideas.md` #19-#22. The log view is delivered. Pass-one closure record and the arc history
are in [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md).

**The sequence — each step's output is the next step's input.** Restructured 2026-08-01: the
oracle test is **no longer a step** (see below).

1. **The MSL survey** ✅ — `examples/survey_msl.rs`. Rumoca's reach across all 2,626 MSL models,
   plus the IR-shape metrics that stratify the sample.
2. **Fidelity testing at scale** ✅ — F1-F9 over that corpus. **2,614 of 2,626 models green**
   (2026-08-01); 12 exceeded this machine's memory or the time limit.
3. **The verification pause** ✅ — [`docs/verification-plan.md`](docs/verification-plan.md), all
   six items landed 2026-08-01: the must-fire convention and its audit, the stale-negative test,
   clippy cleared and denied, the pre-commit suite memoised (375s → 113s), **headless UI testing
   with `egui_kittest`**, and the run drivers resolved by splitting.
4. **The UI pause** ✅ — [`docs/ui-pause-plan.md`](docs/ui-pause-plan.md), landed 2026-08-02.
   Tests first, then refactoring, at Doug's direction. **`App` 105 → 57 fields**, `frame_ui`
   727 → 419, `central_panel_ui` 771 → 430, 504 → 524 tests, and `model_list.rs` /
   `tour.rs` split out of `app.rs`. Six state groupings now own what was scattered across
   `App`. **The field-count ratchet** (`doc_citations::app_does_not_regrow_its_field_count`)
   keeps it there: raising it requires the reasoning in the same commit.

   **What the pause did *not* settle**, recorded so it is not assumed: `app.rs` still ends the
   day at 9,434 lines, and the claim that its size causes editing defects is unproven either
   way — the honest test is whether `ui-findings.md`'s R-series stops recurring, which only
   the next substantial edit can show.

5. **The corpus list** ✅ **CLOSED 2026-08-03** — `docs/ideas.md` **#52**. Three sources behind
   one filter, built 2026-08-01. **The join it argued for was deleted rather than built**, on
   the sweep's evidence: 2,614 rows, `outcome=ok`, `n_violations=0`, no failed checks. A
   fidelity column would read `ok` on every row and a fidelity predicate would match everything
   or nothing.

   **The zero counts this time, and did not before.** Earlier sweeps ran those checks against
   `{"classes":{},"within":null}` and found nothing because there was nothing there. The
   2026-08-02 run walked a real Modelica AST — mean peak memory 1,228 → 1,353 MB, and F7 went
   from sampling ~2 nodes of the Parse stage to its 400-path cap.

   **What reopens it:** a report with a *non-constant* column. The oracle (#43) is the live
   candidate, since findings vary per model by construction.

6. **The draggable divider** ✅ — `docs/ideas.md` **#59**, built and confirmed working
   2026-08-03. `SplitState`: both panels resizable, clamped to 15–75 %, opening at 40/60.

   **The split is a fraction of the window, not a stored pixel width**, and that distinction
   was the bug: the first frame reports a window size that does not exist (5000 px observed),
   so 40 % of it was stored as an absolute 2000 px and clamped to the 75 % maximum on the real
   window. **Five attempts; the sixth came from instrumenting rather than theorising** —
   `ui-findings.md` C15, and the rule it produced is in the rules section above.

7. **← NOTHING IS LIVE.** Every step above is closed, so the next thing built is chosen rather
   than resumed. **Doug has new features to describe (2026-08-03)** — hear those before
   picking from this list, which is a standing menu and not a queue.

   In rough order of value: #46 (a failure specimen and tour per compiler phase —
   the largest item serving the learning mission, since phases that only ever succeed cannot
   be diagnosed), #49 **re-scoped** (fixture tours were sized for "everything a test cannot
   reach", which the pause measured at *two surfaces*, so that entry now drives work sized for
   a world that no longer exists), and #43 as a track.

**[`docs/reports.md`](docs/reports.md) held the design authority for the corpus list.** Its
load-bearing claim — **survey → eligible, fidelity → trustworthy, oracle → findings**, joined
on `name` — **is now half retired.** The list shipped; the join did not, because two of the
three reports turned out to be constants (see step 5). The claim stands for the *oracle*, whose
findings vary per model by construction, and that is the case which would reopen it.

**The oracle (#43) is a TRACK, not a step** *(2026-08-01, Doug)*. It was step 4 and gated the
work; it does not belong there.

- **It never blocked the list**, and the list does not need it to be *tested* either: the survey
  (2,626 rows) and the fidelity report (2,614) are two real sources with genuinely different
  shapes — *browse* versus *exceptions* — which is what exercises a filter. A third report would
  be **new columns, not a new shape**.
- **Its value is elsewhere**: Doug's education (an independent adjudicator, which is why *oracle
  first* is a standing practice — it corrects Claude's bias toward blaming its own specimen) and
  **upstream**, where `upstream-strategy.md` calls differential testing the rarest thing Doug
  brings.
- **One constraint survives because it is free, and it is now the only live piece of the join:**
  *if* an oracle report is ever produced, it must emit the same `name` join key. That binds the
  **oracle's** design, and retrofitting it later would cost the join that #52 deleted for want
  of a non-constant column.

**A dependency the sequence used to hide, now met:**

- ~~The list needs a compile-by-qualified-name path in the worker.~~ ✅
  **`WorkerState::compile_model_by_name` exists** — built for step 2, since checking HRW's
  representation of an MSL model means compiling it *through HRW's own path*, which is the thing
  under test. Note **why it cannot just call `compile` with the library file**: a library file
  may declare many classes — `Blocks/Continuous.mo` holds `CriticalDamping` among others — so
  "the first class in the file" is the wrong model. The document is **located, not added**.

**The signal that dropping the mode was wrong**, recorded so it stays recognisable rather than
being rationalised away: a question that genuinely **cannot be expressed as a filter** over the
list's rows. That would mean something Test-mode-shaped was right after all, and it should
reopen `docs/ideas.md` #52 — which is now closed, so reopening it is a deliberate act rather
than a drift.

## Running things

```text
cargo test -p hrw --lib -- --test-threads=1                        # ~8s,   431 tests — between edits
cargo test -p hrw --lib --features slow-tests -- --test-threads=1  # ~2min, 491 tests — before committing
cargo clippy -p hrw --all-targets                                  # covers the BIN; check the exit code
```

**`--test-threads=1` is required** — two pre-existing tests race on process-global stdout and
on `focus.json`, and the suite can **hang** under the default harness on a clean tree.

**`cargo test` does not build the binary, and that gap is not theoretical.** On 2026-07-31 a
`#[cfg(test)]` was placed above the first of three lifted helpers — **the attribute applies to
one item** — so two compiled into `--bin hrw` referencing test-only imports. Every test passed;
**Doug's debugger launch failed.** `cargo clippy --all-targets` covers the bin, **but check its
exit code, not its output**: the same breakage survived a clippy run piped to
`grep -c "^warning: "`, which counts warnings and silently ignores a compile error.

**Use the fast suite between edits and the full one before every commit.** Measured 2026-07-29:
49 of 402 tests took 180 of the suite's 183 seconds, nearly all compiling a specimen against the
MSL. They are gated by `slow-tests` and reported as ignored *with a reason*. **Parallelism is
not the fix** — they serialize on a global `Mutex<WorkerState>` regardless, saving about two
seconds; `docs/ideas.md` **#48** (memoize compiled specimens) is.

**Long runs → [`docs/long-runs.md`](docs/long-runs.md)**, the runbook for the MSL survey and the
fidelity sweep: copy-paste commands, what to watch, how to resume, what each abort verdict
means. *Why* each precaution exists is `docs/architecture.md` §11.

**NEVER run the fidelity sweep unbounded, and never in a bare loop.** An unbounded 53-model run
made Doug's machine unusable and forced a hard power-cycle (2026-07-31). Use the watchdog:

```powershell
# stop rust-analyzer FIRST via Ctrl+Shift+P -> "rust-analyzer: Stop server"
./scripts/measure-fidelity.ps1 -ModelsFile C:/tmp/all-models.txt `
    -Out C:/tmp/fid-full.csv -Profile C:/tmp/fid-full-memory.csv
```

**One model per process**, so the worst case is bounded by a single model. **A session rebuild
is not a memory bound** — it releases what the session holds, not what the allocator
fragmented. **Only process exit is.** The watchdog guards on **free RAM** (3 GB floor), not
process size, sampled during the run: Doug proposed a 30 GB ceiling on a 31.7 GB machine, and
*a guard that cannot fire is indistinguishable from no guard*.

- Long runs go in a **standalone terminal**, not VS Code's.
- Output goes to `C:\Users\dougd\rumoca-runs\`, **never `C:\tmp`**, and is promoted into `docs/`
  by `cargo run -p hrw --example promote_run`, which writes the provenance sidecar.
- **Do not rebuild an example while a run holds its binary.**
- **Stop rust-analyzer first** — it holds ~5.7 GB here. **Do not kill the process**; VS Code
  treats that as a crash and restarts it within seconds.

**THE OWED SWEEP IS DONE** — run 2026-08-02, promoted 2026-08-03. Trigger 3 had fired twice:
the Parse stage of a library model went from `{"classes":{},"within":null}` to its declaring
file's full AST, and every `Location` in it gained the document URI.

**Result: 2,614 `ok`, 0 violations, 0 failed checks, 12 not checked** (3 free-RAM, 2
proc-ceiling, 7 timeout — all limits of this machine, not findings).

**And this zero counts, where the previous one did not.** Four F-checks walk
`StageKind::COMPILATION`, which begins with Parse, so they ran on every model before too — and
found nothing because there was nothing there. F7 samples up to 400 paths per stage and was
getting about *two* from an empty AST. It now walks a real one. Mean peak memory rose
1,228 → 1,353 MB, which is the ASTs being built.

**What it establishes**: HRW's path grammar round-trips over real Modelica ASTs at corpus
scale. **What it does not**: that HRW's AST equals Rumoca's — nothing in the sweep compares
them. That equivalence is `worker::tests::hrw_reparse_of_a_library_file_matches_the_sessions_own_ast`,
over 120 documents. **Representation is verified at corpus scale; equivalence at sample scale.**

**When the fidelity checks run** (policy 2026-07-31; reasoning in
[`docs/fidelity-plan.md`](docs/fidelity-plan.md)). Small scale — the 16 curated specimens —
**stays in the pre-commit run** (~90 s), answering *"did HRW drift from itself?"*, which is not
a rare event: both bugs found on 2026-07-31 were HRW-internal drift, weeks old. Large scale gets
its own feature gate. Run the large suite: **(1)** after rebasing on upstream (a step in
`docs/updating-rumoca.md`); **(2)** before submitting a PR to CogniPilot/rumoca; **(3)** when
HRW changes how it **emits or reads stage JSON** — the `*_to_json` functions in `worker.rs`, the
path grammar in `bridge.rs`, `IncidenceMatrix::from_report`, or any animation's re-derivation.
**Trigger 3 is code-shaped, not judgement-shaped, deliberately** — "when a change gives reason
to doubt fidelity" is exactly the judgement that already failed twice.

---

## Where things live

- **Rumoca source** — HRW lives **inside** the fork; read the sibling `../crates/...` directly.
  It is the exact tree HRW builds against, no Cargo-cache indirection. "Updating Rumoca" means
  **rebasing the `hrw` branch on upstream**, per
  [`docs/updating-rumoca.md`](docs/updating-rumoca.md).
- **[`docs/compiler-phases/`](docs/compiler-phases/) — Claude's teaching database.** **Audience
  is Claude, not Doug**, who reads it only indirectly through answers; Claude maintains and
  commits it. Start at
  [`the-chain-of-problems.md`](docs/compiler-phases/the-chain-of-problems.md). **What goes in:**
  Doug's *questions*, the confusion behind them, and what made a thing click — **not** Claude's
  explanations, which are regenerable and build an echo chamber a later session mistakes for
  fact. **Every claim carries provenance** ([`docs/provenance.md`](docs/provenance.md));
  untagged prose is a **lead, not a fact**, and upgrades lazily when a real question sends
  Claude into the source. Two tests in `src/doc_citations.rs` check that cited paths exist.
- **[`docs/question-ledger.md`](docs/question-ledger.md)** — Doug's questions verbatim and what
  made each click. **Scan it before answering in a familiar area.** A repeat branches two ways
  demanding opposite responses: the concept is hard (try a different angle), or the thing is not
  visible in HRW (a feature request, better than any Claude invents).
- **[`docs/upstream-strategy.md`](docs/upstream-strategy.md)** — **consult when planning work**,
  not only when preparing something to send. Engagement is a **means** to Doug's education, so
  questions must be worth answering: *"here are 380 MSL models failing at flatten with the same
  error shape — expected?"* beats *"why does X?"*. **Order deliverables by their cost to accept,
  not our effort** — bug reports with System Modeler adjudication, an MSL capability map and
  differential testing are zero-cost gifts; **HRW goes last**, being the only item asking for
  maintenance burden. Anything published must be **reproducible** and **honestly bounded**.
- **[`docs/upstream-issues.md`](docs/upstream-issues.md)** — **Claude adds entries and never
  files them.** Only *reproduced* bugs, with suspect code marked unverified: a confident wrong
  diagnosis wastes a maintainer's time and costs the credibility this project is building.
- **[`docs/fixture-tours/`](docs/fixture-tours/) — tours that are *tests*, not explanations.**
  Versioned, unlike an ad hoc tour (`.hrw-bridge/tour.md`, gitignored). **Only justified because
  something runs them:** `fixture_tour_links_all_resolve` parses every link on every test run.
  Three rules, each bought with a defect:
  - **One tour per capability, narrow.** The scarce resource is **Doug's attention per
    expectation**, not his walks; a wide tour consumes the surplus that produced the off-stop
    findings (`docs/ideas.md` #49).
  - **An expectation must say WHERE to look.** Doug reported "nothing happened" at a stop that
    was correctly refused with the reason on screen — the tour never said notices live in the
    status bar.
  - **Every `**Expected:**` line must be violable.** "Mostly collapsed" where the truth is
    *fully* collapsed tests nothing, and hedged expectations teach Doug to read them loosely.
- **[`docs/specimen-notebook/`](docs/specimen-notebook/)** — per specimen: `trace/` (durable
  per-stage IR + manifest, from `cargo run --example gen_trace -- <Model>`, **generated and
  therefore correct by construction — any number about a specimen is read from here**) and
  `purpose.md` (why it exists; rendered as the Purpose tab).
- Architectural invariants are in Rumoca's numbered SPEC files; comments cite Modelica Language
  Specification sections. **Respect phase boundaries** — IR crates are pure data.

## Architecture rules (charter §4.4, Decision 6)

- Rumoca is linked **as a library**, via path deps on `../crates/rumoca-*`. **Never shell out to
  the Rumoca CLI.** A load-IR-from-JSON import path is retained as a secondary mode only.
- Compilation and simulation run on a **worker thread**, results returned over a channel. The
  egui `update()` loop never blocks and never calls the compiler or solver directly.
- Native builds only. No WASM, no web deployment (charter Decision 5).
- **One generic serde-value tree inspector** pointed at every stage's IR — not per-stage bespoke
  tree widgets. Graph and custom-painter views arrive in their own arcs.
- **New pipeline stages must be wired into ALL per-stage systems** — stage-diff highlight,
  stage-file publishing, and the notebook trace.

## Debugging conventions

The VS Code debugger is a first-class learning instrument: structure code so a breakpoint can be
set inside a Rumoca phase while it processes a specimen.

- Breakpoints belong in **actions** (button handlers, worker tasks), **never in the per-frame
  paint path.** Keep compile/simulate logic out of rendering code.
- `[profile.dev.package]`: keep full debug info on all Rumoca crates.
- Setup, launch config and failure signatures: [`docs/setup-windows.md`](docs/setup-windows.md).

## Specimen rules (charter §4.3, §4.1)

- Specimens live in `specimens/`, authored in Wolfram System Modeler, in the **portable Modelica
  subset** — no Wolfram extensions. Done = compiles and runs equivalently in both.
- **Every specimen carries a `// purpose:` comment** (one line, phenomenon-focused), plus a
  `docs/specimen-notebook/<Model>/` trace and `purpose.md`.
- **Scratch specimens live in `.hrw-bridge/specimens/`** — Claude writes them mid-conversation to
  answer a question; HRW lists them within a second, no restart. **Not** held to the rules above,
  and **ephemeral by construction**. **A scratch name may not shadow a curated one** — the
  collision is reported and the file skipped, because silently loading a different model than the
  name says would have Claude reason confidently about source Doug is not looking at.
- **No MSL MultiBody.** Mechanical components come from our own small planar library.
- Comparison protocol: identical solver tolerances and initial conditions, explicit `experiment`
  annotations; agreement metric = relative error on state trajectories and event-time deltas.
- **Prefer standards** — MSL and portable Modelica over custom implementations.

## Arc close-out ritual

An arc is done when: (1) the specimen passes the differential test in both toolchains; (2) the
arc's observatory pane renders the relevant IR; (3) Doug has single-stepped the phase in the
debugger on that specimen; (4) the trace log (IR before/after) is captured; (5) this file's
Current work section is advanced. *(Gates 1 and 3 are under review — treat as
satisfiable-by-acceptance; `docs/ideas.md` #4.)*
