//! Do the documentation's source citations still point at real files?
//!
//! `docs/compiler-phases/` is **Claude's teaching database** (`docs/ideas.md` #41), and
//! its value depends on being trustworthy on re-read. Prose rots silently; a *citation*
//! does not have to. A path is checkable, so it gets checked — mechanically, on every
//! test run.
//!
//! This is #41 stage B, built as a **test rather than the example binary the idea
//! sketched**: an example has to be remembered and a test does not, and "remembered" is
//! exactly the property that failed for every stale record this project has found.
//!
//! What it cannot check is whether the prose *around* a citation is still true. That is
//! stage C's job (provenance tags), and the reason untagged text is a lead, not a fact.
